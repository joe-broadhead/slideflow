## ðŸ”§ How It Works

SlideFlow works in three simple steps:

1.	**Define:** You create a YAML file that defines your presentation. This includes the Google Slides template to use, the data sources to connect to, and the content for each slide (text, charts, etc.).
2.	**Connect & Transform:** SlideFlow connects to your specified data sources, fetches the data, and applies any transformations you've defined.
3.	**Build:** SlideFlow creates a new presentation, populates it with your data and charts, and saves it to your Google Drive.
