"""Constants and configuration values used throughout the Slideflow package.

This module centralizes all constants, default values, configuration parameters,
and magic numbers used across the Slideflow framework. It provides a single
source of truth for framework-wide settings, making configuration management
and maintenance easier.

The constants are organized into logical groups using nested classes, providing
namespace separation and making it easy to find and modify related values.
This approach improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of
configuration drift across the codebase.

Key Constant Categories:
    - GoogleSlides: Google Slides platform-specific constants and defaults
    - MimeTypes: Standard MIME type definitions for file operations
    - FileExtensions: Common file extension constants
    - Defaults: Default values for various operations and configurations
    - Charts: Chart generation and rendering constants
    - Registry: Function and provider registry configuration
    - Logging: Logging system configuration and format strings
    - Templates: Template processing and parameter substitution settings
    - ErrorMessages: Standardized error message templates
    - Cache: Caching system configuration and operation types
    - Concurrency: Concurrent processing settings and limits
    - Validation: Data validation thresholds and patterns
    - Environment: Environment variable names for external integrations
    - Status: Operation status indicators and state definitions

Example:
    Using constants throughout the application:
    
    >>> from slideflow.constants import GoogleSlides, Defaults, ErrorMessages
    >>> 
    >>> # Google Slides configuration
    >>> chart_width = GoogleSlides.DEFAULT_CHART_WIDTH
    >>> slide_width = GoogleSlides.STANDARD_WIDTH_POINTS
    >>> 
    >>> # Default AI model selection
    >>> model = Defaults.OPENAI_MODEL
    >>> max_workers = Defaults.DEFAULT_MAX_WORKERS
    >>> 
    >>> # Error message formatting
    >>> error_msg = ErrorMessages.API_AUTH_FAILED.format(
    ...     provider="OpenAI", 
    ...     error="Invalid API key"
    ... )
    
    Environment variable access:
    
    >>> from slideflow.constants import Environment
    >>> import os
    >>> 
    >>> api_key = os.getenv(Environment.OPENAI_API_KEY)
    >>> debug_mode = os.getenv(Environment.DEBUG, "false").lower() == "true"
    
    Chart configuration:
    
    >>> from slideflow.constants import Charts
    >>> 
    >>> # Set up chart rendering
    >>> dpi = Charts.DEFAULT_DPI
    >>> width = Charts.DEFAULT_WIDTH_PX
    >>> height = Charts.DEFAULT_HEIGHT_PX

Design Principles:
    - All magic numbers and hardcoded values should be defined here
    - Constants are grouped logically for easy discovery and maintenance
    - String templates use format() syntax for consistent parameter substitution
    - Environment variable names follow standard naming conventions
    - Default values are chosen to work well for most common use cases
    - Configuration is designed to be easily overridden when needed

Maintenance:
    When adding new constants:
    1. Choose the appropriate category or create a new one if needed
    2. Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the constant's purpose
    3. Add inline comments for complex or non-obvious values
    4. Follow existing naming conventions (UPPER_CASE for constants)
    5. Update this module docstring if adding a new category
